# Android-OpenCL-Mandelbrot
An Android application computing the Mandelbrot set with OpenCL. The application is composed of a Java part and a native part. The Java part handles UI events, and the native part initializes the OpenCL compute devices, compiles OpenCL kernels, and dispatches kernel executions. The Java part communicates with the native part through Java Native Interface (JNI). Computation workload is configurable by adjusting the resolution. Part of (or full) workload can be also assigned to a cloud service for computing, SSH is used to issue a remote execution command and SFTP is used to fetch the remotely computed results. In case of workload distribution, remotely computed result is combined with the locally computed result to form the Mandelbrot set. The application comes with an UI for adjusting the resolution and workload distribution. The application is tested on 2nd generation Moto G and Sony Xperia ZL, both phones feature Qualcomm chipsets.
